              We treat common pets like dogs, cats, and rabbits, ensuring they receive 
              the best care possible. We also attend to exotic pets such as hamsters,

              experienced in providing care for birds, including parrots and canaries. 
              In addition, we look after larger animals like horses, cows, pigs, and 
              goats. Whether it's a family pet or a farm animal, our veterinarians are
